# Object-Detection-with-Pre-trained-models
Using Different State-of-the-Art Pre-trained models for Object Detection.

### This app has been deployed on Streamlit Sharing.ðŸ¥³
 [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/hardly-human/object-detection-with-pre-trained-models/streamlit_deployment/app.py)

## Application Implements 4 Image Based Object Detection Models:

  - **Single Shot Detector(SSD) Model.**
  
  - **Faster R-CNN(Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) Model.**
  
  - **YOLO(You Only Look Once) Model.**

  - **CenterNet Model.**
