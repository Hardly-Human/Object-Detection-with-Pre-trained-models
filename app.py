			## Why Use Pre-trained Models ?
			*Intuitively, A model is just a function that takes some 
			data as input and tries to estimate the resultant output by 
			tuning its `Weights` which is reffered to as `Training of the model`.
			This process of Training model requires a lot of Computational Capabilites.
			Especially, In`Computer Vision`tasks simple Classification and Recognition
			training tasks require GPU's to attain a adequate accuracy.*

			*Researchers, Engineers and Developers all across the globe have been working 
			to solve these problems and Thanks to `Opensource` Collaboration Communities 
			many problems are being solved with different methods, perspectives and Algorithms.*

			*Every Developer/Researcher doesn't have access to such high computation environments
			inorder to train different algorithms multiple times. Most of the problem-solvers 
			post their ideas,solutions and trained models on internet.*

			**`gluoncv` is a python package which provides us with pre-trained models 
			to solve a wide variety of Computer Vision Tasks.**

			*With packages like these any developer in world can have access to knowledge
			of using these models to build better products and **`Make world a better place`** *
